      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>I started learning Python as my first programming language, but it took some time for me to realize that the language is just the tool. Now, tools have to be used where they fit best..</p>

      <h3>Web development</h3>
      <p>I’m a self-taught web developer and have been doing web development for more years than I care to count.My advice is to start with the very basics—and only the very basics. Don’t run before you learn to walk. Get the fundamentals down and gradually work your way up.</p>

      <h3>Data Science</h3>
      <p>Data Science being a science, is a pretty huge field. The answer is my personal perception of how to start your journey.Firstly, it is important to understand what data science means and the different fields that come together to form it. When I started my learning path in Data Science, I had no shape or form. I went through a lot of courses and materials that had no connections whatsover.</p>
