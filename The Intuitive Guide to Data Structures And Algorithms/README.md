# The Intuitive Guide to
# Data Structures And Algorithms
```
This is not a freaking textbook. No confusing academic jargon. No long lists of properties to memorize. No proofs. Because that stuff doesn't help you actually get it.

Here's what does: Learning what to picture in your head when you think of a dynamic array or a hash map. Learning how to think in algorithms.

That's what this guide is focused onâ€”giving you a visual, intuitive sense for how data structures and algorithms actually work.

So if you've got a big coding interview coming up, or you never learned data structures and algorithms in school, or you did but you're kinda hazy on how some of this stuff fits together...

This guide will fill in the gaps in your knowledge and make you say, "Oooh, that's how that works."

We'll walk you through it all, step by step. Starting from the beginning.
