# The Intuitive Guide to Data Structures And Algorithms
```
This is not a freaking textbook. No confusing academic jargon. No long lists of properties to memorize. No proofs. Because that stuff doesn't help you actually get it.

Here's what does: Learning what to picture in your head when you think of a dynamic array or a hash map. Learning how to think in algorithms.

That's what this guide is focused on—giving you a visual, intuitive sense for how data structures and algorithms actually work.

So if you've got a big coding interview coming up, or you never learned data structures and algorithms in school, or you did but you're kinda hazy on how some of this stuff fits together...

This guide will fill in the gaps in your knowledge and make you say, "Oooh, that's how that works."

We'll walk you through it all, step by step. Starting from the beginning.

# 1.Big O Notation
## Using not-boring math to measure code's efficiency

## The idea behind big O notation

Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem.

It's like math except it's an awesome, not-boring kind of math where you get to wave your hands through the details and just focus on what's basically happening.

With big O notation we express the runtime in terms of—brace yourself—how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large.

Let's break that down:

   1. **how quickly the runtime grows—** It's hard to pin down the exact runtime of an algorithm. It depends on the speed of the processor, what else the computer is running, etc. So instead of talking about the runtime directly, we use big O notation to talk about how quickly the runtime grows.
   2. **relative to the input—** If we were measuring our runtime directly, we could express our speed in seconds. Since we're measuring how quickly our runtime grows, we need to express our speed in terms of...something else. With Big O notation, we use the size of the input, which we call "nnn." So we can say things like the runtime grows "on the order of the size of the input" (O(n)O(n)O(n)) or "on the order of the square of the size of the input" (O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2)).
   3. **as the input gets arbitrarily large—** Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when nnn is small but are eclipsed eventually by other steps as nnn gets huge. For big O analysis, we care most about the stuff that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly eclipsed as nnn gets very large. (If you know what an asymptote is, you might see why "big O analysis" is sometimes called "asymptotic analysis.")

If this seems abstract so far, that's because it is. Let's look at some examples.
